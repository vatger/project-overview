**Looking for Developers:** <br/>
Whilst we are always looking for developers and are very happy with contributions to our open-source projects, we have
decided to categorize these projects according to their current need of new developers.

Projects marked with ✅ indicate
that the team working on this is actively looking for new developers that are willing to join the core development team.

Projects marked with ❌ indicate that the team isn't actively looking for new members, however are grateful for any open-source
contributions that are made. Please note that this icon doesn't mean that there is no work to be done. Open-source commits are, as stated previously, always welcome!
